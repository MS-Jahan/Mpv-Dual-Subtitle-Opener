# Mpv-Dual-Subtitle-Opener
Open and View Dual Subtitle With Mpv At Once!

Before using this script, download [mpv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/) and [add mpv executable to path](https://gist.github.com/Nogooduser/2b6923cb0769b951e9d56fd586b29e63#guide-to-installing-mpv).

Just a script, use wherever you want to use. The icon isn't mine, just found from Google search.

If you don't know how to use this script, just [download binary](https://github.com/MS-Jahan/Mpv-Dual-Subtitle-Opener/releases/latest) from here (Windows Only).
